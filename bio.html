                <p>Richard, known to some as Rafa, is a seasoned leader with over a decade in the creative industry, including six years spearheading web design initiatives. He's this unique blend of independent thinking and practical adaptability, 
                  valuing both analog depth and digital innovation, always asking questions and on the hunt for timeless solutions and pushing for continuous growth. His early immersion in rapidly evolving technology, stemming from his 90s upbringing, fundamentally shaped his strategic perspective and ability to drive change in dynamic digital landscapes.</p>
                <p>His broad range of interests, from sports and photography to physical music collections (yes, actual physical formats!) and digital playlist curation – and now a growing passion for motorcycling – speaks to a well-rounded individual who understands diverse consumer touchpoints and creative engagement. 
                  This multifaceted perspective allows him to connect seemingly disparate elements, fostering holistic solutions and anticipating customer needs. He's not just a doer; he's a strategic mind who can leverage varied insights to drive business objectives while learning from the best.</p>
                <p>After a focused effort to earn his Graphic Design degree from Jorge Tadeo Lozano University in 2014, Richard immediately began building a robust foundation of real-world experience. His early ventures, including managing website content and providing exhibition support at the Valenzuela Klenner Art Gallery from 2009, 
                  quickly evolved into a practical understanding of digital and print production. This hands-on background, combined with his continuous learning mindset, positions him as a visionary leader ready to guide teams and organizations through complex digital transformations.</p>
              <p><strong>Interests:</strong> sports, photography and books, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/almosteclectic_/reels/" target="_blank">music collection in physical formats</a> or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/sec888" target="_blank">playlist creations</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/motorblack.co/" target="_blank">motorcycling</a>.</p>
                <!-- <p>He worked various jobs to afford the latter stages of his graphic design studies. Initially, it wasn't more than a job to pay college fees but then he understood (apart from perfecting his english skills) the importance of addressing customer service <strong>from a design perspective</strong> because we're human beings after all, sometimes we like to take care of each other, and according to him, both visual language and culture play an enormous role on keeping the world sane (to some extent).</p> -->

                    <h2>Visual design</h2>
                    <p>By using his experience both as an analog and digital designer, Rafael makes sure that a brand identity can be used to its full extent far beyond the logo in a user-friendly way [as long as the involved parts allow it]. Not just timelessly in its conception, but also usable in today's digital world.</p>

                    <p>Even though he's had installed and deployed websites <em>(Drupal/Wordpres/Prestashop)</em> on his own, he prefers to focus on the front end. This is really helpful when the time to work side by side with developers comes along because it allows them to communicate in an almost symbiotic way to determine what can and cannot be done in a project, in terms of timely and technical constraints.</p>
